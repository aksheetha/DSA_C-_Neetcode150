Anagram Check Implementation
This code defines a class Solution with a method isAnagram that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is defined as a string that contains the exact same characters as another string but in a different order.

Code Overview
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(std::string s, std::string t) {
        // Step 1: If the lengths of the strings are not equal, they cannot be anagrams
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Step 2: Create an unordered_map to store character counts from the first string
        std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;

        // Step 3: Count the frequency of each character in string s
        for (char c : s) {
            charCount[c]++;
        }

        // Step 4: Decrease the count for each character in string t
        for (char c : t) {
            charCount[c]--;
            // If any character's count goes below zero, t has more of that character
            if (charCount[c] < 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Step 5: If all character counts are balanced, return true
        return true;
    }
};
Explanation
Length Check:

The function first checks if the lengths of s and t are equal. If not, it immediately returns false, as they cannot be anagrams.
Character Count Initialization:

An unordered_map named charCount is created to keep track of the frequency of each character in string s.
Count Characters in s:

A loop iterates through each character in s, incrementing its count in charCount.
Decrement Counts for t:

Another loop processes each character in t, decrementing its count in charCount.
If any character count goes below zero, it indicates that t has more instances of that character than s, leading to an immediate return of false.
Final Check:

If the function has not returned false by this point, it implies that s and t are anagrams, so it returns true.
